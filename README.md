# Expression
A scripting programming language focused on providing a simple way to evaluate math expressions in the terminal.

# When
Not entirely sure **when** or **if** I will start this project but I really want to make an interpreted programming language and the use case for this makes sense to me. 


# What will be expected to be possible

Simple math expressions evaluated in the terminal like 

``expression (1*2 + 3^4) / 4``
or even 
``expression expression1.exp * expression2.exp``
Allowing the programmer to write expressions in files and call reference them within other code as already evaluated statements
